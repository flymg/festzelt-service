## SETUP  

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**  
You need to create a Telegram Bot, so your first step would be to talk to Botfather.
A detailed manual can be found here:   
[Create a telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)  
The token created by Botfather is a string like `123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` that is required to authorize the bot and send requests to the Bot API.

2. **Start a chat with your Bot**  
You also need a **chat_id**, where vacancies should be delivered by the bot. The `commands` below can help you find the id:
```sh
BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

# Start a Chat with Bot for private communication
# Launch the following command after that:
curl -s https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates \
| python3 -c "import sys, json; print(str(json.load(sys.stdin)['result'][0]['message']['from']['id']))"

# As an alternative, you can also add the bot to a group channel
# Launch the following command after that:
curl -s https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates \
| python3 -c "import sys, json; print(str(json.load(sys.stdin)['result'][0]['message']['chat']['id']))"
```

The response is a **chat_id**, group chats start with a `-`. You are ready to go!  

## BUILD

```sh
docker build -f dockerfile -t festzelt-service .
```

## RUNNING

Start the bot and watch vacancies.  

```sh
docker run \
    -it \
    -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \
    -e TELEGRAM_CHANNEL=-987654321 \
    -v festzelt-service:/app/data \
    --name festzelt-service festzelt-service
```
The Bot is a 9-5 worker, Mo-Fr. This is usually the time when staff updates vacancies. Change the cron scheduler job if you like other business hours.

## BOT CONTROL

There are some build in commands in the bot to make it easier to control the service.
Following commands exit:
```
/start  - Main Menu, have a look at the Seatmap
/log    - Status of last vacancy lookup
/stop   - Stops the Service
```

## CUSTOMIZATION
By default, the Bot will look for `Mittag` and `Nachmittag` vacancies on all days of the week.  
This can be changed by by using comma seperated lists when launching the service.

```sh
-e DESIRED_TIMES=Nachmittag
-e DESIRED_DAYS=Montag, Dienstag, Sonntag
```
